# GraphT-T

GraphT–T (V1.0Beta), a program for embedding and visualizing quasi-
infinite periodic graphs in 3D Euclidean space.


The following is a description of how the T-T and T…T constraints are integrated into
the 3D embedding algorithm.

1. T-T distances: the distances between linked vertices are constrained by treating
edges as springs that behave according to Hooke’s Law.

2. T…T separations: the distances between unlinked vertices are constrained by a
repulsive force between them described by Coulomb’s Law.


This tool is created based on a web-based Graph reporting and algorithm framework [WebGTea](https://webgtea.github.io) which 
is a try to have a complete JS version of [GraphTea](http://graphtheorysoftware.com/).
